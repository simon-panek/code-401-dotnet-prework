# Code Challenges 
For each of the challenges below, create a new console application. Each of your challenges should be done in the `Program.cs` 
file. Utilize the `Main()` method, and create external methods as appropriate. 

Practice using your git work flow during the construction of this project. Refer to the git work flow doc as a reference. 

## Problem 1: Array Max Result

#### Problem Statement
Given an array select the number that will give you the maximum result

#### Selection and Scoring Algorithm
You can select any number from the list, however your scoring will be depend on the frequency of that number in the list. 
E.g for [2,2,3,5,4] if you pick 2 your score will be 4 (2*2) but if you pick 5 your score will be 5 (5*1)

#### Input Format
An array of integers

#### Sample Input
[6,4,1,1,3]

#### Sample Output
6

#### Readme
Your readme should contain basic information outlining the requirements for the challenge
1. Name of Challenge
2. Instructions of Challenge
3. Screen capture of successful output.

## Problem 2: Leap Year Calculator

#### Problem Statement
Given a year, report if it is a leap year.

The tricky thing here is that a leap year in the Gregorian calendar occurs:

```
on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
  except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
    unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400

```

For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is. 1900 is not a leap year, but 2000 is.

## Problem 3: Perfect Sequence

#### Problem Statement
Given a sequence. Return "Yes" if the sequence is considered a perfect sequence. Otherwise, return "No"

#### Perfect Sequences
A perfect sequence is a sequence such that all of its elements are non-negative integers and the product of all of them is equal to their sum. 
For example: [2,2], [1,3,2] and [0,0,0,0] are perfect sequences and [4,5,6] and [0,2,-2] are not perfect sequences. Negative numbers of any kind are not valid in 
a perfect sequence

#### Input Format
An array of integers (may not be sorted)

#### Sample Input
[1,3,2]

#### Sample Output
Yes

#### Explanation
1 * 3 * 2 = 6 && 1 + 3 + 2 = 6
